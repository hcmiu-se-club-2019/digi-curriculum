### Documentation
https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/iu-se-club/DigitCurriculum/1.0   
[source](./swagger.yaml)
### Usage
1. First, we need to create database
   + Example: We create database with name _syllabus_mirror_ 
       + Step 1: Connect to mysql database: `mysql -u <username> -p <password>` 
       + Step 2: Create database with name _syllabus_mirror_: `create database syllabus_mirror;`
2. Second, we config DB_USER, DB_NAME, DB_HOST, DB_PASSWORD in _.env_ file
3. Next, run command: `npm install` to install all package
4. After install all package, run `node sequelize.js` to synchronize database & model
4. Run app with command `npm start`
5. Run all query in file _all.sql_ to fullfill data into database
6. Using swagger for API Documentation
